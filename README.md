## Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ files/                 # Main source code files
â”œâ”€â”€ test_bowling.py        # Unit tests for the game
â”œâ”€â”€ bowling.py             # Core logic for score calculation

â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json, etc.    # Cyber-Dojo configuration files

## Features

- Calculates bowling scores frame-by-frame
- Supports all rules:
  - Strikes (`X`)
  - Spares (`/`)
  - Misses (`-`)
  - Tenth frame bonus logic
- Includes unit tests using `pytest`

## How to Run
